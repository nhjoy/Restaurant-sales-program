A sales report generating program for a restaurant

Write a program for a restaurant. Your program should display a main menu that allows the customer to select between the food menu option, drink menu option, and check out option (Figure 1.1). After selected an option from the main menu, your program should continue to display a sub-menu that will show the available foods/ drinks and prices (Figure 1.2 and Figure 1.3). Your program should allow the customer to select the food/ drink and enter the order quantity (Figure 1.4). Your program should continue to allow the customer to order their food/ drink until they select the check out option in the main menu. Then your program will display the order list with the quantity, prices and total amount need to pay by the customer. Allow the user to enter the cash amount they are going to pay and calculate the balance for them as shown in Figure 1.5 on the screen. Then, ask the user to select whether exit or back to the main menu for other customer make an order. Your program should able to calculate the total sales as shown in Figure 1.6 and display it into the output file.

-•	Use array (one-dimension or two-dimension) to store the order and the output.
-•	The program should be written in several functions for example `orderfood()` function to select food menu, `displaylist()`function to display order list, `displayreport()` etc. Each function must be implemented with the concept of parameter passing. Use appropriate arguments for each function. Do not use global variables.
